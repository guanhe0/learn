IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY!
Someone could be eavesdropping on you right now (man-in-the-middle attack)!
It is also possible that a host key has just been changed.
The fingerprint for the ECDSA key sent by the remote host is
7a:7c:7b:63:55:58:45:66:68:19:8a:ba:b1:1b:c5:6d.
Please contact your system administrator.
Add correct host key in /root/.ssh/known_hosts to get rid of this message.
Offending ECDSA key in /root/.ssh/known_hosts:14
  remove with: ssh-keygen -f "/root/.ssh/known_hosts" -R 192.168.3.192
Keyboard-interactive authentication is disabled to avoid man-in-the-middle attacks.
